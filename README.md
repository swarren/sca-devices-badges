# SCA heraldic image (scalable)

This repository contains SCA device, badge, etc. images. The aim is to provide
vector (scalable) versions of these images, to allow users to use the images
at varying scales. Some images were originally drawn by someone else, then
converted to a scalable format by me. Some were drawn from scratch by myself.
See the file sources.txt for brief details of provenance.

Images are divided into a separate directory per kingdom: 
* [Outlands](outlands/)

I use Inkscape (https://inkscape.org/) to create these files. It's free (Open
Source), cross-platform, and reasonably good software.

# Pro Tips

The SVG files contain many elements outside the visible document area. If you
import the PDF or SVG files into most software, such as a word processor,
you'll simply see the expected device or badge. However, if you open the SVG
files in Inkscape (or likely any other similarly capable SVG editor), you'll be
able to see all the extra elements. The extra elements will give valuable tips
about how I constructed the images, which may be useful when creating your own
drawings.
