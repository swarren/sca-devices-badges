# SCA heraldic image (scalable)

This repository contains SCA device, badge, etc. images. The aim is to provide
vector (scalable) versions of these images, to allow users to use the images
at varying scales. Some images were originally drawn by someone else, then
converted to a scalable format by me. Some were drawn from scratch by myself.
See the file sources.txt for brief details of provenance.

Images are divided into a separate directory per kingdom: 
* [Outlands](outlands/)

I use Inkscape (https://inkscape.org/) to create these files. It's free (Open
Source), cross-platform, and reasonably good software.
